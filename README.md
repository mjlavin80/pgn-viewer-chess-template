This project is an attempt to create an easy-to-deploy, javascript-based template to load a PGN file (a flat text format that represents a game of chess) into a simple viewer that allows you to play through a game, move by move, and view commentary/annotations about the game. Click on the menu links to view a basic board, a board with an annotation window, an annotated board with bootstrap4 styles, and a bootstrap4 board with custom CSS.</p>
